# OGAN-TextToImage
Imagine that you can see the scene by a  sentence. When you are reading a novel, the map will automatically change according to the text you read. These have only appeared in science fiction movies. But related research makes text-to-image generation possible. In  recent years generic and powerful recurrent neural network architectures have been developed  to learn discriminative text feature representations. Meanwhile, deep convolutional generative  adversarial networks (GANs) have begun to generate highly compelling images of specific categories.In this work, we develop a novel deep  architecture and Orthogonal Generative Adversarial Networks to effectively  bridge these advances in text and image modeling, translating visual concepts from characters  to pixels.
